          <h3>Online Coaching</h3>

          <p>
            The Symmetry Online Coaching System delivers a personalized Body Transformation plan designed to help you feel stronger, healthier and better!<br> Based on a professional assessment of your current fitness levels, eating and dietary habits,
            and your defined goals, we will create a step-by-step guide that includes a progressive weight training program, a macro-based comprehensive nutrition plan, and advice on critical vitamin and mineral supplements.

          </p>
          <h2>HOW IT WORKS!</h2>
          <p> Fitness Assessment Progressive training phases <br> Macro-based diet plan <br> Weekly virtual check-ins <br><br> Every training phase lasts for 4 weeks and works to build on your current fitness level. At the beginning of each phase, individualized
            program sheet will be shared with you outlining your lifting schedule for the next 4 weeks. As you progress through the program, you’ll be tracking your progress online and sharing it with the The Symmetry Team; this helps us keep a close
            eye on your progress throughout each phase.<br><br> Building a healthy relationship with food is critical for achieving your goals. Please be sure and accurately record everything you are eating and drinking so that at your weekly virtual
            check-in, the Team can analyze and assess your progress. At The Symmetry Training System, we take a macro-based approach to caloric management that gives you the flexibility and confidence you need to eat properly.<br><br> Plans change, life
            happens and sometimes getting and staying motivated is the hardest part. That’s why, each week we’ll connect via email. This will be your opportunity to ask questions, discuss progress, and stay motivated to achieve your goals. On a specific
            day, you’ll send your questions and current progress photos, and the team will review and respond with extra tools and advice.<br><br> Feel Stronger | Feel Healthier | Feel Better
